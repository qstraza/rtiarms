      <h1>Safety Facts - Priest</h1>

      <p>We feel obligated to explain few points since there are some roumors about the Priest
      not being safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are using seamless hidraulic tube for a connectoin between front and rear body which is produced by EN 10305-4 (DIN 2445/2).
        Narrowest point in our design has diameter of 10,5mm. Inner hole is 8,2mm which gives us thickness of 1,15mm. Lowest point of the threads is 10,77mm (they are also supported with a female thread).
      </p>
      <p>
        Regular dynamic working presssure for tube of dia 10mm with a wall thickness 1mm is 249 bar which gives us a stress of 99,6 N/mm2 (<a href="https://s3c.pneumatikatlas.com/shop/media/atlas8_neutral_seiten/373_n.pdf">reference</a>). Out of this it can be calculated that for our case, which is
        diameter 10,5mm, wall thickness 8,2mm is 28 N/mm2 which equals to 280 bar of DYNAMIC pressure. This formula takes in to account
        all safety factors, which is more than twice (and is still in normal levels - meaning plastic deformation will not yet happen - proven with our test as well).
        <br/>
        <small>
          * When material is in its breaking point, plastic deformations start to happen, which means that after releasing the pressure from the material, it does not return to its original shape/dimension and this changes are 1 % and more, which are easily meassurable/noticable with conventional tools.
        </small>
      </p>
      <p>
        By standard ultimate tensile strength for our tube is 480 MPa, which means that breaking point for Priests (diameter 10,5mm, wall thickness 8,2mm) is <b>1346 bar</b>.
      </p>


      <ul>
        <li>
          We tested the Priest at <b>800 bar</b> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRW5w9cZF4" target="_blank">video</a>) with success and no deformations anywhere (this is 5,3 times over the 150 bar). This means that we were still in range of working pressure (safety marings in this formular are enormous). Currently available high pressure compressors cannot exceed 400 bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          By each shot pressure in regulated area drops only for about <b>20 bar</b> (not really a dynamic environment).
        </li>
        <li>
          By EN 10305-4 standard our tube is made for 280 bar of dynamic working pressure (few 100.000 cycles of filling and releasing the pressure).
        </li>
        <li>
          Working pressure of the Prist is <b>150 bar</b>. This means Priest has a safety <b>factor of 1,9</b> before even getting to a working pressure of the tube and <b>safety factor of 9</b> before breaking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Priest has a safety valve which will act if more than 200 bar is released out of the bottle. With normal use you are unable to get it over 200. Even if somehow the safety valve fails and the pressure manages to reach 300 bar, Priest's weakest point (the tube) will reach its regular, designed, working pressure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Breaking pressure of Priest's weakest point is 1346 bar</b>. This pressure is quite hard to reach with a normal equipment. Normal compressors can fill up to 300 bar, which is, again, working pressure of the weakest part.
        </li>
        <li>
          Famous rifle on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIX_Jkqlkjs" target="_blank">this video</a> has at its weakest point a REAL breaking factor of only 3,4 whereas Priests theoretical breaking point is <b>9</b>. Also taking in to the considuration that factor 9 has enormous safety margins and is in reality much higher (twice or more). (Declared theoretical breaking point of the famous rifle is probably around 250-300 bar)
